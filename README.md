# redux-observables talk

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cskeppstedt/redux-observables-talk.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cskeppstedt/redux-observables-talk)

This repo was used in a live coding excercise in a talk about [redux-observable](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable) at the [ReactJS GÃ¶teborg](https://www.meetup.com/ReactJS-Goteborg/events/244507187/) meetup. It's a small web app that queries the excellent [dad joke API](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api).

The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). The starting point of the talk can be found in the [talk-starting-point branch](https://github.com/cskeppstedt/redux-observables-talk/tree/talk-starting-point).

## What is it

- It's a Redux middleware
- Let's you act on the _stream of all actions_ that flow through your app, and produce new actions that will be dispatched to your store.

## What does it solve

- It let's you leverage the [RxJS](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS) toolbox to express complex async flows/side effects/business logic in your Redux application.

## Presentation deck
